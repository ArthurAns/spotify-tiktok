Creating and maintaining a Spotify playlist full of the current top trending songs on TikTok.
Git in boomers, we're diving in!

# How it works

First we are scraping [Tokboard](https://www.tokboard.com), a website that collects data from the most used sounds on TikTok.
Then, we try to find those sounds on Spotify. Many TikTok sounds are original soungs, like other TikTok's sounds or people talking. Those will be discarded.
Finally, we update the Spotify playlist with all our matches!

# Use cases

- If you are a **TikToker**, make sure you are using the freshest songs for the algorithm to pick up your TikToks so you can get famous and finally pay off that student loan.
- If you are a **Boomer**, you can see this as an anthropological dive into the Zoomer culture and bond with your niece at the next family dinner.
- If you're a **nerd**, don't get mad at my ugly code, just turn on this playlist, get outside and touch some grass.
